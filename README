The files in this directory provide tools for conjugating the
Portuguese verbs.

- Conjugate.pm is a perl module with low-level tools (see manpage)
- conjug       is a perl program that conjugates verbs (see manpage) 
- treinar      is a perl program that drills the user on conjugation. 


Quick demo :

perl -e 'use Lingua::PT::Conjugate; print conjug("programar","perfeito")'

programar :                                                          
perf         programei programaste programou programamos programaram

                   Term::ReadLine::Gnu are more friendly.
